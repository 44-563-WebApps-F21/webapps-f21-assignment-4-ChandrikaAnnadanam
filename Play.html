<pre>
    LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Takes chair and goes across L.C._]  I am quite
    miserable, Lady Windermere.  You must tell me what I did.  [_Sits down at
    table L._]
    
    LADY WINDERMERE.  Well, you kept paying me elaborate compliments the
    whole evening.
    
    LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Smiling_.]  Ah, nowadays we are all of us so hard up,
    that the only pleasant things to pay _are_ compliments.  They’re the only
    things we _can_ pay.
    
    LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Shaking her head_.]  No, I am talking very seriously.
    You mustn’t laugh, I am quite serious.  I don’t like compliments, and I
    don’t see why a man should think he is pleasing a woman enormously when
    he says to her a whole heap of things that he doesn’t mean.
    
    LORD DARLINGTON.  Ah, but I did mean them.  [_Takes tea which she offers
    him_.]
    
    LADY WINDERMERE.  [_Gravely_.]  I hope not.  I should be sorry to have to
    quarrel with you, Lord Darlington.  I like you very much, you know that.
    But I shouldn’t like you at all if I thought you were what most other men
    are.  Believe me, you are better than most other men, and I sometimes
    think you pretend to be worse.
    
    LORD DARLINGTON.  We all have our little vanities, Lady Windermere.
    
    LADY WINDERMERE.  Why do you make that your special one?  [_Still seated
    at table L._] 
    LORD DARLINGTON.  [_Still seated L.C._]  Oh, nowadays so many conceited
    people go about Society pretending to be good, that I think it shows
    rather a sweet and modest disposition to pretend to be bad.  Besides,
    there is this to be said.  If you pretend to be good, the world takes you
    very seriously.  If you pretend to be bad, it doesn’t.  Such is the
    astounding stupidity of optimism.
    
    LADY WINDERMERE.  Don’t you _want_ the world to take you seriously then,
    Lord Darlington?

            Dear Mr. LORD DARLINGTON, how nice of you to come so early.
            We all know how you are run after in London.

        <h4 class="name LADY WINDERMERE.">LADY WINDERMER.</h4>

        <p class="speech ">
            Ah! we know your value, Mr. Hopper. We wish there
            were more like you. It would make life so much easier. Do you know, Mr.
            Hopper, dear Agatha and I are so much interested in Australia. It must
            be so pretty with all the dear little kangaroos flying about. Agatha has
            found it on the map. What a curious shape it is! Just like a large
            packing case. However, it is a very young country, isn’t it?

        <p class="speech ">
            How clever you are, Mr. Hopper. You have a
            cleverness quite of your own. Now I mustn’t keep you.

        <p class="speech ">
            What does he mean?  Do, as a concession to my poor
wits, Lord Darlington, just explain to me what you really mean.

        <h4 class="name duchessBerwick">DUCHESS OF BERWICK.</h4>
        <p class="speech "> Well, I hope she has a dance left. Have you a dance
